            <h1>What is anger?</h1>
            <p>Anger management is when a person has anger management issues, it usually means that they have trouble managing their anger and often act out their anger in a destructive, rather than constructive, manner. It is normal for humans to sometimes lose control of their tempers by means of yelling or screaming.</p>
            <p>The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change them, but you can learn to control your reactions.</p>
            <p>Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person (such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems. Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings.</p>
